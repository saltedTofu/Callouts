## Introduction
 - This project is intended to be a tool for people who are trying to learn callout locations for the various competitive maps in Halo 3.
 - Users can select which of the seven maps they want to learn via the nav bar or by scrolling through the page.
 - Each map component shows a blueprint of the map and a list of all the callouts for the map on the left hand side. When the user mouses over either the callout name on the callout list or the location on the blueprint, they are both highlighted in green.
 - The right hand side of each map component will show an in-game screenshot of whichever location is being viewed.
 - For smaller resolution devices, the maps will show the blueprint with the callout names printed on it.
## Technologies
 - React.js
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS
 - GIMP for photo editing
## Features
- Utilizes React.js functional components with hooks.
- SVG used to create the divs for each callout

## Room for Improvement
- No Blueprints were available for the maps Amplified and Onslaught, so these had to be made by me with limited photo-editing skills. I would like to spend more time on them so they look more uniform with the other maps.
- A checkbox could be added to give the option to add callouts on top of the blueprints (like they are for smaller resolutions) if user wants them at the larger resolutions.
